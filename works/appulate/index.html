        The former workflow was complicated, agents often got lost, and couldn't
        find information and figure out what to do next. The new one has become
        more linear and step-by-step.</span

      <h2>Request Quote</h2>
      <span class="text"
        >After the insurance is created, the agent requests a quote from
        insurance companies. A quote is a document with the terms and premium of
        insurance, if they are suitable for the agent's client, the binding
        procedure will start.</span

      <span class="text"
        >Previously, the agent first chose the markets. Their questions were
        automatically merged into a single form. After filling it out, the agent
        requested quotes from several markets at once.</span
      >
      <span class="text">This approach had problems:</span>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>
          The forms got gigantic, with an inverse dependence of questions, a
          complex structure and nesting.
        </li>
        <li>
          It took a lot of time to develop the algorithm for merging forms of
          several markets
        </li>

    <section>
      <span class="text"
        >After observing the work of the agents, we concluded that it was better
        to make the agent request quotes from the markets one at a time.</span
      >
      <span class="text">Advantages of the new approach:</span>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Agents get quotes faster as the forms have become shorter.</li>
        <li>
          The design of the forms has become simpler, and the structure is
          controlled manually. This allows us to properly organize the sequence
          of questions, make a convenient structure and get rid of nesting.
        </li>
        <li>Developers have started to add new forms of markets faster.</li>
